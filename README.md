# Stitch-Customs-Keyboard-Project
This is a mockup site I made for a friend that has his own keyboard  brand. I made a responsive site that has a different layout for mobile and desktop organized using SCSS. I created a full screen menu for the mobile layout that does not appear on desktop mode using both SCSS and JavaScript.  For the work page, I created a gallery that displays a lightbox display for each keyboard once its clicked.
